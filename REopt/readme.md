# Data Visualizations Using Sample Data from NREL's REopt API

### A Brief Explanation

  One of the most difficult tasks to master with data visualization is knowing what information to use
  to make the graph.  That's the position I currently find myself in - I know that I don't know enough about
  the information that's coming back to make optimal choices for optimally meaningful graphs.  I'll continue to research what exactly each field is, but this project is, at the moment, an exercise in API consumption rather than optimal, meaningful data visualization.
