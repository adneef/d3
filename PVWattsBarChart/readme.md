# Data Visualization Using Sample Data from NREL's PVWatts V5 API

## See it live!

[Check out a live demo](http://adneef-pvwattsviz.surge.sh/)

This is exactly as the title suggests - a hand-crafted D3 data visualization built using data from NREL's PV Watts V5 api.  In its current configuration, the application uses sample data, but code exists in this repo for a working, very light express server that will successfully make an api call to PV Watts, and return live data.

Everything is responsive, to the place that very small screens will smash everything on top of each other.
